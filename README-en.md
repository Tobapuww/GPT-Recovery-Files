# GPT-Recovery-Files
## This is a set of files that fix partition table corruption caused by phone flashing, modifying partition errors.

[ÁÆÄ‰Ωì‰∏≠Êñá](https://github.com/Tobapuww/GPT-Recovery-Files/blob/main/README.md)
 #
## What can it do? üî•

  - Partition table corruption caused by the use of multiple systemsÔºõ
  
  - The partition table is corrupted due to an incorrect setting of the Magisk moduleÔºõ
  
  - When you find that the official package of the line brush still can't be launchedÔºõ
  
  - Can't use 9008 mode to flash (to verify or fail to verify)Ôºõ
  
  - Other scenarios that may cause the partition table to become corrupted.
  
  
 ## How does it work? üöÄ
 
- Currently, only phones with Qualcomm Snapdragon chips are supported.
  
- Click [here](https://github.com/Tobapuww/GPT-Recovery-tools/device) to find your device manufacturer and device model

- Download devicename.zip to your preferred file location
  
- Unzip file.
  
- Connect your phone, open your favorite flashing tool, or execute the following command from the cmd command line:

- For VAB devices:
  
```bat
  fastboot flash partition:0 gpt_both0.bin
  fastboot flash partition:1 gpt_both1.bin
  fastboot flash partition:2 gpt_both2.bin
  fastboot flash partition:3 gpt_both3.bin
  fastboot flash partition:5 gpt_both5.bin
  fastboot set_active a
```
- For A-only devicesÔºö

```bat
  fastboot flash partition:0 gpt_both0.bin
  fastboot flash partition:1 gpt_both1.bin
  fastboot flash partition:2 gpt_both2.bin
  fastboot flash partition:3 gpt_both3.bin
  fastboot flash partition:5 gpt_both5.bin
```

If you download a zip that doesn't have the file shown in the code, skip it

If that doesn't work:
```bat
  fastboot flash partition:4 gpt_both4.bin
```

- When you're done, follow your preferred method to brush the official image in its entirety.
  
## Normalization
- Originally, I wanted to make a file in .exe format, but I won't use any code that compiles it, if you can write an application for this project, please contact me directly [click here] (https://github.com/Tobapuww/GPT-Recovery-tools/issues).

## Submit support
